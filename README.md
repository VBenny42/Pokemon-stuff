# Pokemon-stuff
Python code to get some Pokemon data for my Discord bot

dexscraper.py prints the national dex number and name of all 898 pokemon (as written on 6th August, 2021) to stdout.
waterscraper.py prints all pokemon with water (as written on 6th August, 2021 :D) as a primary or secondary type.
spriteget.py gets the sprite for each pokemon specified in national-dex.txt, which in turn is output from dexscraper.py
